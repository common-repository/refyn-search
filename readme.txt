Refyn Search gives your customers an awesome search experience delivering stunning 'live' product search results using Artificial Intelligence.

=== Description ===

REFYN - New Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that can search a site using only features. No keywords, no training, and no index are required! E.g. Query of "4x4" will fetch jeep and SUV even if "4x4" is not in DB at all. It will fetch all images with a certain shape, color, and so on without scanning pixels - Just by cognitively understanding that toilet paper has a shape of a cylinder.

For a deme test, please visit https://demo.refyn.org !
